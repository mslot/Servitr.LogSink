# Servitr.LogSink
This project is intended to be used as an enchancment to logging. I want to to be able to search intelligently when logging to Application Insights. I want to be using event ids, and I want to be able to map exeptions to event ids and a thing i call areas. This project is an experiment out into the world of logging.

# Application Insights
This project is using application insights, but other logging sources could be used. Please note that application insights has no reserved event id, so I start my count relative high when classifing exceptions, 6000.

# More to come here
When I get the last bits and pieces stitched together I am going to make some examples of use with references to how I use it with my blog.
